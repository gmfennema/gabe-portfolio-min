        <p>I turned 30 this year. Like any newly minted 30-year-old, I used the milestone to reflect on the last decade and maybe uncover some wisdom that can help me in my next decade. I’ve seen people do this in the form of “advice to my 20-year-old self” or “the biggest lessons I learned in my 20s,” but here’s my take on the trend.</p>
        <p>I’ve spent plenty of time, money, and effort. Which investments delivered the best return? Which ones really gave me outsized gains for what I put into them?</p>

        <h2>1. Home Espresso Setup</h2>
        <p>I grew up on Folgers and still enjoy a cup when I visit my Grandma. But at some point in college I learned what coffee actually tasted like, and I haven’t been the same since.</p>
        <p>Throughout my 20s I experimented with every type of coffee preparation method you can think of: pour-over, French press, AeroPress, and then I found espresso. Three machines later, I landed on my ideal setup: a Gaggia Classic Pro with a Baratza Sette 270.</p>
        <p>Beyond the immense joy that my two to three espresso drinks bring me each day, I believe it’s the closest you can get to purchasing love. Here’s my reasoning: people love coffee. The only thing people love more than coffee is fancy espresso drinks. And more than anything, people love free things. In summary: I give people fancy lattes; they’re forever grateful; and the cost to me is about 60 cents. Excellent ROI if there ever was one.</p>
        <p><strong>To maximize ROI, I recommend:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>If your really like coffee, get an espresso machine</li>
          <li>Spend more on a grinder than on an espresso machine</li>
          <li>Take the time to learn how to make really good coffee</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Taking Photos</h2>
        <p>My living-room TV has this amazing feature that uses my Google Photos as a slideshow screensaver. I have over 30,000 photos documenting my 20s. From climbing on college rooftops to starting a family, I get to relive all of it every day sitting in my living room.</p>
        <p>I invested early on in a DSLR camera (Canon 6DII), which completely paid for itself in random requests from friends to take family, professional, engagement, and (on one occasion) wedding photos. However, now that the cost has been fully recouped, I only accept payment in tequila.</p>
        <p>That being said, get a real camera. Learn to take a good photo. The difference between an iPhone and a full-frame DSLR is night and day, and when you look back on your life, you’ll want nice photos.</p>
        <p>I’ve spent about $1,000 on cameras and lenses, plus $2/month for Google Photos storage. The countless evenings my wife and I spend reliving memories make it one of my best investments.</p>
        <p><strong>To maximize ROI, I recommend:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Get a DSLR with a 50mm lens and learn how to use it</li>
          <li>Take photos all the time</li>
          <li>Pay Google $2/month to store your photos</li>
          <li>Look at them often</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Home Gym</h2>
        <p>I didn’t lift weights until I turned 27. On my birthday, with the imminent arrival of my first child, I decided it was time to hit the gym, and the results have been truly remarkable. My friends jokingly refer to my “before” picture as my POW (prisoner of war) body. The key, like everyone says, is consistency. Three to four times per week for three years will do wonders.</p>
        <p>What they don’t tell you is that doing anything three to four times per week gets significantly harder with each additional kid. Rather than try to find a gym close by, I decided to just build my own garage gym. Now, instead of needing my wife to be home and willing to take care of both kids while I leave for two hours, I have complete flexibility.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Kids down for a nap? Lift some weights.</li>
          <li>Need a quick 30-minute break from work? Lift some weights.</li>
          <li>Diaper blowout on my wife while the toddler is screaming? Pause the workout and go help.</li>
          <li>Finally convinced the kids to go to sleep? Lift weights together with my wife.</li>
          <li>Neighbor is a powerlifting coach? He walks over to my garage and we train together.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The absolute freedom a home gym has provided me is unmatched. It has allowed me to be consistent with my workouts without prioritizing them over family.</p>
        <p><strong>To maximize ROI, I recommend:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>At minimum, get a set of adjustable dumbbells (50 lb+)</li>
          <li>Lift weights at least three days a week</li>
          <li>Use progressive overload to increase the weight you lift</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Vacation Getaways</h2>
        <p>I hate leaving my home. However, my favorite memories are typically made when I’m away from it. Some of the most memorable moments in my 20s were on vacation adventures, going somewhere new with people I love. National parks like Zion, Glacier, and Yellowstone were especially memorable. The irony is that none of these trips went totally as expected. We forgot to reserve Glacier National Park permits, our two-month-old had two blowouts on our way to Yellowstone, and I’m fairly certain we caught COVID while at Zion.</p>
        <p>The highlight of all my 20s trips was a seven-day getaway with my wife to the Netherlands without any kids. This trip probably cost us $3,000, but in return I got memories that I will cherish for the rest of my life.</p>
        <p>While all these trips were fun, I’m convinced that the majority of the enjoyment actually happens outside of the trip itself. Here’s my percieved enjoyment breakdown:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Planning &amp; Anticipation: 20%</li>
          <li>The Trip: 40%</li>
          <li>Reminiscing: 40%</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To maximize ROI, I recommend:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Plan early to maximize the anticipation.</li>
          <li>Go with people you’ll want to reminisce with, ideally lifelong friends or family.</li>
          <li>Create something from your trip (either a photo book or a highlight video) to make it easy to revisit.</li>
          <li>Reminisce often, especially with the people who were there.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Getting Married Young</h2>
        <p>I will be the first to admit that I got lucky. I met my wife freshman year of college, dated her for four years, and got married the summer after graduating. For as much fun as all my friends seemed to be having dating different people throughout college, the allure seemed to wear off shortly after graduation, and now at 30 they all seem to dread it.</p>
        <p>When I first got married, there were definitely people around me who were skeptical. They would say things like, “You’re only 22. You have no idea who this person is going to end up being in 20 years.” And realistically, they’re right. We dated for four years, which gave me enough time to learn about her values, but ultimately neither of us knew what the other would be like in 20 years.</p>
        <p>What I’ve realized, though, is that you don’t wake up at 40 with no input into who your partner has become. In contrast, the earlier you get married, the larger the role you will play in shaping who that person becomes. You don’t control it, but you do have a massive influence.</p>
        <p>Take it seriously, and treat it with urgency. Every year that you are not married to your spouse is not only another year they are being shaped by someone else, but also one less year of shared experiences.</p>
        <p><strong>To maximize ROI, I recommend:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Treat finding your spouse with urgency</li>
          <li>Marry someone who has very similar values to you</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Having Kids</h2>
        <p>There is nothing convenient about kids. You can take almost any situation, add a young child to it, and it instantly becomes both harder and often less enjoyable.</p>
        <p>Driving home alone: Peaceful. Listening to a podcast. Deep in thought.<br/>
        Driving home with kids: Infant is screaming while the toddler is asking why we turned left instead of right, all while “If you’re happy and you know it” is ironically playing on a loop for the fifth time.</p>
        <p>It’s not enjoyable a lot of the time, especially early on. And that’s a good thing.</p>
        <p>We are all selfish: selfish with our time, happiness, plans, sleep, money; the list goes on. You know what kids demand of you? All of it. If you are looking for the absolute fastest way of becoming less selfish, have kids.</p>
        <p><strong>To maximize ROI, I recommend:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Have as many kids as your think you can handle, then stretch for one more.</li>
          <li>Loosen your grip on the things you thought mattered most.</li>
          <li>Enjoy a home full of kids you’ll treasure more than anything you gave up.</li>
        </ul>

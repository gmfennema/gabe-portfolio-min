        <h3><strong>A Lesson From History</strong></h3>
        <p>In 1971, the Ford Pinto made its debut and left an explosive impact on the automotive industry. The car was notorious for its tendency to explode when rear-ended, a consequence of a design flaw that resulted in a $128 million lesson in the Law of Triviality.</p>
        <p>The Law of Triviality is an observation that people often spend more time and energy on insignificant issues while overlooking more important ones.</p>
        <p>Lee Iacocca, the newly-appointed president of Ford, was determined to introduce a mid-sized sedan to compete with emerging European models. His directive to the team was clear: create a car weighing under 2,000 pounds and costing no more than $2,000. Ironically, the safer, non-explosive version of the Pinto would have cost a mere $11 more.</p>

        <h3><strong>The Mistake We Still Make</strong></h3>
        <p>It’s been over 50 years since Ford’s fiasco, but we still constantly make this mistake in business. A meeting about a website re-launch devolves into everyone giving their opinions on button color. The majority of a marketing campaign meeting is spent debating the subject line of an email.</p>
        <p>If marketing teams are prone to any errors, it's usually this one. Teams often include dreamers or "idea people" who are eager to shift focus away from the main goal to something more fun, and typically less important.</p>

        <h3><strong>What Needs to be Done</strong></h3>
        <p>There are many meeting frameworks that work: Level 10, Scrum, standups, Eisenhower Matrix, Lean Coffee, and so many more. However, there is one framework that will ensure your failure, not having one.</p>
        <p>Humans are distractible. This is why we need systems, to keep us focused. Setting a meeting objective and then reviewing progress toward it at the end of the meeting is a good place to start.</p>
        <p>Stop meeting without a purpose and hoping to make progress.</p>

        <p>I've been trying to think more strategically about my career recently, and there is a metaphor that has served as a helpful lens through which to view my professional choices. The idea is to take cues from Cal Newport's <em>So Good They Can't Ignore You</em>, a book that I can't recommend enough. The idea is to view your career like you would an investment portfolio. This portfolio should be made up of long term investments, <em>career capital</em>, and short term investments, <em>company capital</em>.</p>

        <h2>Career Capital</h2>
        <p>Think of career capital as your stock portfolio, full of various stocks of skills, experiences, and relationships that you expect to appreciate over time. These investments enjoy the benefit of compound interest.</p>

        <h3>Picking Stocks</h3>
        <p>Picking skills, experiences, and relationships in the workforce is very similar to picking stocks in that there are safe bets that will perform predictably over time, and then there are risky bets that might do well for a while and then disappear into nothing.</p>
        <p>Safe bets vary widely by industry, but for the construction industry, this might look like learning framing, tiling, finishing, electrical, and project management skills. For an office worker, this might look like practicing copywriting, learning Excel, and also project management skills.</p>
        <p>Risky bets also vary widely by industry. For example, in the tech world, this would be spending time to learn a new coding language that you believe has a bright future. This might pay off when you have a head start on everyone else, or the language might never become widely adopted, and your time will be wasted. For an architect, it might look like specializing in a new style of design which they predict will grow in demand over time.</p>
        <p>Relationships and experiences work much in the same way, and high returns tend to favor those who place a lot of bets. However, instead of purchasing these stocks, you invest your limited time, so choose wisely.</p>

        <h3>Selecting Job Features</h3>
        <p>In his talk at Google, Cal Newport argues that rather than following your passion, you should select a job based on desirable features. Some features might include high pay, impactful work, flexible schedule, prestige, etc. These job features are scarce; people aren't just handing out fulfilling work. Otherwise, your first job, when you have 0 career capital, wouldn't be at McDonald's. Therefore, in exchange for these scarce resources, you need to offer something scarce or of high value in return.</p>
        <p>You exchange your career capital for opportunities with desirable features. This can include both the type of work you do, as well as specific job perks. However, your career capital must exceed that of others who also want these perks. You must have some combination of skill, experience, and relationships that make you more valuable than every other person who wants a job with these features.</p>

        <h3>Compound Interest</h3>
        <p>The best part about investing in career capital is that the longer you hold (and care for) these investments, the returns grow exponentially. The difference between a programmer with 10 years of experience in a given language and someone with 2 years of experience can be monumental. A decade-long relationship far exceeds the value of 10 one-year relationships.</p>

        <h2>Company Capital</h2>
        <p>If career capital is your investment portfolio, company capital is your cash on hand. This is extremely spendable and helpful in the short term, however, it depreciates over time.</p>

        <h3>Acquiring and Spending</h3>
        <p>Another way of thinking about company capital is your reputation, or the amount of goodwill you have in your current organization. You can build up this reserve by delivering results to your team and boss, working well with others, and then publicly giving them credit when possible.</p>
        <p>Spending company capital is happening constantly. Whether it's asking someone to attend a meeting, assembling a team to tackle a project, or any other activity that requires other people to buy-in. If you have stored up enough capital, you can easily exchange it to grease the wheels of your next project. If you acquire enough, it can even be used to purchase perks such as pay raises, promotions, flexibility, etc.</p>

        <h3>Use It Or Lose It</h3>
        <p>Unlike career capital, company capital diminishes over time. That favor you did for Debbie 2 years ago can hardly be remembered anymore, and assuming predictable turnover, the people you build your reputation with will slowly disappear. Eventually, you will also leave the company, and the extra hours, one-off projects, and impossible deadlines you met will either be a bullet point on your resume or lose their value completely.</p>
        <p>I would by no means advocate not investing in company capital, but rather do so with the knowledge that if you don't use it quickly, it will lose its value over time. Don't wait 2 years to negotiate the pay raise; do it right after a big win. In fact, strategically plan your big asks around your big wins for maximum conversion value.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Now, this is by no means a perfect way to describe career investments, but rather a way to help better understand two different forms of leverage that can often be confused. Ultimately, reputation in a company <em>can</em> have an impact on your career capital by opening doors to unexpected relationships. It can also have the opposite effect if you have a negative reputation.</p>
        <p>The mistake I see many people make in their first job is investing everything they have in company capital, but find out all too late that they under-invested in their career capital and have significantly less bargaining power than they thought. This is how you can get trapped at a company. If you have more company capital than career capital, your current role is better than anything else you can go out and find. While that might seem great in the short run, over time you will realize that your ability to negotiate is severely compromised by a lack of competition.</p>

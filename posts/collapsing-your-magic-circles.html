        <h2>The Games We Play</h2>
        <p>Life is full of games. Not just video games, but the kind you don’t even realize you’re playing.</p>
        <p>Sometimes they’re obvious: your career ladder at work, a sports league, your side hustle. Other times they’re subtle: the unwritten rules in your friend group, the “perfect” morning routine you’ve built, your obsession with getting your toddler to nap on schedule.</p>
        <p>We step into these little worlds, these “games”, and they give us structure. They have goals, rules, a sense of progression, and reward systems. At work, the “game” might be a promoting (or series of promotions). In fitness, it might be hitting a PR on the bench press. Competing over home upgrades, landscaping, or even holiday decorations.</p>
        <p>The trick is that you don’t always realize when you’ve entered one of these worlds. You just start playing. And because it feels real inside that circle, you start making choices, spending time, and even shaping your identity around it.</p>
        <p>So how do you know which games you’re actually playing?</p>
        <p>Here are a few questions that help me identify games I am playing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are there times in my life right now where I get tunnel vision, or hyper fixated on?</li>
          <li>What am I willing to sacrifice for? (time, money, relationships, etc.)</li>
          <li>What are the things I can talk for hours about?</li>
          <li>What would future me be surprised I cared so much about?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Collapse of the Magic Circle</h2>
        <p>In game theory and game design, there’s this idea called the “magic circle<sup><a href="#fn1" aria-label="Footnote 1">1</a></sup>.” It’s the imaginary boundary where the game’s rules and reality take over. Inside that circle, the game is reality; the points, challenges, and victories matter.</p>
        <p>The “collapse” happens when that illusion breaks. Reality intrudes, and you suddenly see the game for what it is: just a game.</p>
        <p>I had this happen playing Pokémon on my phone for the first time. I was loving it. I was immersed, exploring, grinding to level up my team. Then I wondered, “I bet there are cheat codes for this.” Sure enough, there were. I entered one to get a rare Dragonite early, and… instantly, the magic was gone. I didn’t want to play anymore. The fun evaporated because the rules no longer meant anything.</p>
        <p>That collapse happens in real life too.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A coworker gets laid off after years of loyalty, and suddenly you see your company’s “career ladder” for what it is, a structure that serves the company first, not you.</li>
          <li>Someone dies, and for a moment, all the petty games of life. Office politics, Instagram likes, even certain ambitions feel like dust.</li>
          <li>You finish a side project you poured yourself into and weeks later, you can’t remember why it mattered so much.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The collapse can be jarring. Sometimes it’s disappointing, even depressing. But it’s also clarifying.</p>

        <h2>Intentionally Collapsing Your Magic Circles</h2>
        <p>Most of the time, magic circle collapse happens by accident, through loss, success, or disillusionment. But what if you made a regular practice of intentionally collapsing these magic circles?</p>
        <p>Here’s why I think it’s a good practice:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Taking time to clearly identify the games you are currently playing helps avoid unintentional gameplay. There will always be someone else out there who wants you to play their game, whether that's a social media company, a boss, or even status seeking friends. You should know at all times which games you are actively opting in to.</li>
          <li>You get to pick better games. If you realize the game you’re playing isn’t worth the time or energy, you can swap it for one that is.</li>
          <li>You get to choose how you play. Once you know something’s a game, you can step back in willingly, without the illusion that it’s ultimate. You can pick your own milestones and rewards, and then choose a strategy that serves you.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It’s the difference between being unconsciously swept along by a game and saying, “Yep, I’m going to play this one, and here’s how I’m going to keep it in perspective.”</p>

        <h2>Make it a Habit</h2>
        <p>If you want to make this a habit, try asking yourself these every so often:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If this game ended tomorrow, was it still worth playing?
            <ul>
              <li><em>If I got laid off tomorrow, was it still worth it to work here?</em></li>
              <li><em>If this person moved away tomorrow, was our relationship worth the effort?</em></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>What benefits am I getting apart from the points, status, rewards?
            <ul>
              <li><em>What health benefits does working toward an increased benchpress PR give me?</em></li>
              <li><em>What transferrable skills or experiences am I gaining from work?</em></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Am I playing this because I genuinely enjoy it, or because I think I have to?
            <ul>
              <li><em>Do I actually like homeschooling my kids, or am I doing it because it feels expected?</em></li>
              <li><em>Do I still enjoy posting on social media, or am I just keeping up appearances?</em></li>
              <li><em>Do I keep my house perfectly clean for my own enjoyment, or for other's approval?</em></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Who benefits most from me playing this game?
            <ul>
              <li><em>Is the 6-year development program that my boss is putting me on help me build real skills, or increase employee output and likelihood of retention?</em></li>
              <li><em>Is the volunteer coordinator asking me to do more because they care about me or because it makes their life easier</em></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sometimes, just stepping out mentally is enough to pop the illusion for a moment. And when you go back in, you’ll know you’re choosing it, on your own terms.</p>
        <p>At their best, games are good. They can bring us immense joy, bond people together, or even push us to do what we otherwise thought was impossible. But at their worst, games and trick us into making costly sacrifices, or make us feel like we are failures when not measuring up to an arbitrary standard. The only difference between being trapped in a magic circle and being the master of it is the ability to step outside and see it for what it is, a game.</p>

        <p>There’s a subreddit called “I’m the main character” that documents individuals who seemingly have no regard for those around them. They live life as if it is a singular narrative, with themselves as the central figure. While some may attribute this behavior to social media platforms like TikTok, the pervasive use of phones, or simply dismiss it as youthful ignorance, I believe the root issue lies in the nature of the stories we are told.</p>
        <p>The hero’s journey, a narrative pattern identified by Joseph Campbell, is well-known. In this structure, a hero ventures forth on an adventure, confronts a crisis, overcomes adversity, and returns home transformed. The Lord of the Rings is a quintessential example. However, this isn’t the only narrative approach. I’ve recently become interested in what I would term “episodic epics.” These stories unfold across numerous distinct narratives and are characterized by their grand scale.</p>
        <p>Two examples that epitomize this format are Isaac Asimov’s The Foundation Trilogy and Genesis, the first book of the Bible. The Foundation Trilogy was originally published as eight short stories featuring varying characters at different times. Its overarching narrative revolves around preserving knowledge and mitigating chaos during the collapse of a galactic empire. Similarly, Genesis consists of various individual stories with unique characters, underpinned by themes like the creation of humankind, their descent into evil, and the initiation of God’s plan for redemption through the nation of Israel.</p>
        <p>These stories are not only intriguing but also serve as essential narrative forms that encourage humility. They diverge from the self‑centric focus of the hero’s journey, prompting a broader, more global perspective. Most importantly, they remind us that we are not the main character.</p>
